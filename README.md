Tracker is a tool aimed at helping you monitoring your time.

### Synopsis


Tracker is a tool aimed at helping you monitoring your time.

  You just have to tell Watson when you start working on your project with
  the 'start' command, and you can stop the timer when you're done with the
  'stop' command.

  Heavily inspired by Watson from TailorDev (https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson/)
